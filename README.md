#Burrito Challenge

##Introduction
Burrito Challenge is a memory game built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. 
The goal of the game is to remember a customer's order by clicking on the correct burrito ingredients within 30 a second timeframe.
When done selecting, the user clicks the 'Finish Burrito' button to find out if she has won the current round
and will progress to the next, or if she has lost. As the user wins more and more rounds, more and more ingredients are required to correctly build the burrito, thus adding a challenging
component to the game. 

All DOM is done using jQuery and some inline styling.

##Approach
Good front end design is very important as I begin building my portfolio, so I started this project by gathering the necessary assets
and creating a non-functioning front end with the intent of later adding functionality. By ensuring a solid grasp on the appearance of 
my game, it was easier to manipulate assets by adhering to the design principles I initially set forth. 

Many functions evolved as time went on; for example, initially the Order Alert was plain-looking HTML Alert, which was then changed to 
a div that was inserted for 10 seconds before vanishing, to then a div that would remain on screen until the user dismissed it by 
clicking it. 

##Unsolved Problems
1. When an ingredient is clicked and moved to the Burrito section, it cannot be removed
2. Didn't have time to look into some animation effects that I wanted to implement -- upon losing, highlighting the needed ingredients, bouncing effect when hovering over ingredients, etc.
3. REALLY wanted to implement some Media Queries
